Hadoop-Oozie-Job

DESCRIPTION

Encapsulates an Oozie job which you configure,
submit to a remote Oozie server (via the REST API),
run, and inquire the status of.
Also allows you to "attach" files to the job
which will be uploaded to HDFS when the job is submitted
(these files will typically be mapper and reducer code,
and a workflow description file in XML format).

Note: this module has only been tested on simple map-reduce jobs in Hadoop streaming mode.
